# Yolov3
This repository contains a complete from-scratch implementation of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, v3) object detection model. The model architecture, loss functions, and training pipeline were all implemented without relying on pre-built deep learning frameworks like Ultralytics or pre-trained weights.

Despite a fully functional model pipeline, inference is not yet working as expected due to unresolved issues, and training was limited due to computational constraints on Google Colab. Future improvements include debugging inference, refining the training strategy, and optimizing the model for better performance on resource-limited hardware.
